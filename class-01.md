**Why we have to learn HTML & CSS?**
*Understanding HTML and CSS 
can help anyone who works 
with the web; designers can 
create more attractive and 
usable sites, website editors can 
create better content, marketers 
can communicate with their 
audience more effectively, and 
managers can commission 
better sites and get the best out 
of their teams.*

## **How People Access the Web?**
Access the Web?
Before we look at the code used to build 
websites it is important to consider the 
different ways in which people access the web 
and clarify some terminology.

- **Browsers** :People access websites using 
software called a web browser. 
Popular examples include 
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, 
Chrome, and Opera.

- **Web Servers**:When you ask your browser for 
a web page, the request is sent 
across the Internet to a special 
computer known as a web 
server which hosts the website.
Web servers are special 
computers that are constantly 
connected to the Internet, and 
are optimized to send web pages 
out to people who request them.

- **Screen readers**:are programs 
that read out the contents of a 
computer screen to a user. They 
are commonly used by people 
with visual impairments.


### **How Websites Are Created?**
___________
**Small websites** are often written 
just using HTML and CSS.

**Larger websites** — in particular 
those that are updated regularly 
and use a content management 
system (CMS), blogging tools, or 
e-commerce software — often 
make use of more complex 
technologies on the web server, 
but these technologies are 
actually used to produce HTML 
and CSS that is then sent to the 
browser. So, if your site uses 
these technologies, you will be 
able to use your new HTML and 
CSS knowledge to take more 
control over how your site looks.

 # **Structure**
_______________ 
 . In this section we will:
● See how HTML describes the structure of a web page
● Learn how tags or elements are added to your document

This might be expanded upon 
under subheadings lower down 
on the page. When using a word 
processor to create a document, 
we separate out the text to give 
it structure. Each topic might 
have a new paragraph, and each 
section can have a heading to 
describe what it covers.

- **Tags** act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags
_____
- **Attributes** provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign.
