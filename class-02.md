# **HTML Text**
______
*When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page*

* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it).

* Structural markup:the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

* **Headings**
HTML has six "levels" of heading.

**Semantic Markup**

- < strong> The use of the < strong>element indicates that its content has strong importance

- < em> the < em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence

- < blockquote> and < q >

 - Abbreviations & 
Acronyms:In HTML 4 there was a separate < acronym> element for acronyms. To spell out the full form of the acronym, the title attribute was used (as with the < abbr> element above). HTML5 just uses the < abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms

- < address>T element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.

- < s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted)

### Introducing CSS

*CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.*

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

 **statement**:series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

 You should write **comments** to explain what your code does. they help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

-  **variables**: temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data.

*Sometimes you will want to use a double or single quote mark within a string. Because strings can live in single or double quotes, if you just want to use double quotes in the string, you could surround the entire string in single quotes. If you just want to use single quotes in the string, you could surround the string in double quotes*

##### **Decisions and loops**
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
* if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
