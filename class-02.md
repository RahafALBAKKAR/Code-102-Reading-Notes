# **Text**
______
*When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page*

* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it).

* Structural markup:the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

* **Headings**
HTML has six "levels" of heading.

## Semantic Markup

- < em> the < em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence

- < blockquote> and < q >

 - Abbreviations & 
Acronyms:In HTML 4 there was a separate < acronym> element for acronyms. To spell out the full form of the acronym, the title attribute was used (as with the < abbr> element above). HTML5 just uses the < abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms

- < address>T element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.

- < s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted)

### Introducing CSS

*CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.*

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
