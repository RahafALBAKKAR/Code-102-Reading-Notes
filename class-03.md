# **Lists**
![list](http://tutzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/nested-list.jpg)
 HTML provides us with three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

## **CSS\Boxes**

- By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

- **The overflow property** is 
particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable mess. Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.

### **Array in Javascript**

*a list or a set of values that are related to each other.*
- how to creat Array?
1.You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by thename of the array).

2.The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.

let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana']

*Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array.*

**ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY**
 To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets. 

You can change the value of an item an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item).
