# **Lists**
![list](http://tutzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/nested-list.jpg)
 HTML provides us with three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

## **CSS\Boxes**

- By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

- **The overflow property** is 
particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable mess. Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.
