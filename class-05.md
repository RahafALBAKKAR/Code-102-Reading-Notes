* Three Rules for Creating Images

1.Save images in the right format

2.Save Img in right size.

3.Use the correct resloution.

*When an image is a line drawing (such as a logo, illustration, or diagram), designers will often create it in vector format.Vector formatted images are very different to bitmap images*
*The advantage of creating line drawings in vector format is that you can increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it*

* Each extra frame of the image increases the size of the file, and can therefore add to the time it takes for an image to download (and web users do not like waiting a long time for images to download).

 _______
 ### **TEXT**

 The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters).
 
 |Typeface Terminology| define|
 |--------|-----|
 |Serif |Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs|
 |Sans-Serif|Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.|
 |Monospace|Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)|

* **Unit of type of style**

 Setting font size in pixels is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended (because percentages and ems are more likely to vary if a user has changed the default size of text in their browser).Pixels are relative to the resolution of the screen, so the same type size will look larger when a screen has a resolution of 800x600 than it would when it is 1280x800
