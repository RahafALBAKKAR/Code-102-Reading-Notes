# **Understanding the problem domain**
________
*Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming*

* What is the hardest thing about writing code?

    1.Learning a new technology
    2.Naming things
    3.Testing your code
    4.Debugging
    5.Fixing bugs
    6.Making software maintainable

* Why problem domains are hard?
We should put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

* **Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain**
 * we should  write the code to produce.

* **What can you do about it?**

If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

    1.Make the problem domain easier
    2.Get better at understanding the problem domain

You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.
