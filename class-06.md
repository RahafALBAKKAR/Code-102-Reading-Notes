*Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming*

* What is the hardest thing about writing code?

    1.Learning a new technology
    2.Naming things
    3.Testing your code
    4.Debugging
    5.Fixing bugs
    6.Making software maintainable

* Why problem domains are hard?
We should put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

* **Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain**
 * we should  write the code to produce.

* **What can you do about it?**

If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

    1.Make the problem domain easier
    2.Get better at understanding the problem domain

You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

## **WHAT IS AN OBJECT? **
*Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. *
**property:** if a variable is part of an object.tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
**method**: if a function is part of an object,represent tasks that are associated with the object.
**key**: properties and methods.
An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is because keys are used to access their corresponding values.
