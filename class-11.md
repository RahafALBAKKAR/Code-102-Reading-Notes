## practical Information

* Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
 is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
 
- On-page SEO: All on-page SEO strategies happen on your website.
- Off-page SEO: All off-page SEO strategies happen off your website.
 
 - Why care about how SEO works? 
 The Internet has really put the world at our fingertips. We are usually not more than a few clicks away from almost any information we could be looking for. When people are looking for information, services, products, and so on, they go online.

Try to remember the moment you thought, “I should really look up how search engine optimization works.”

You knew exactly what to do: You got on the Internet and you searched for “how SEO works.”

What did you do then?

Odds are you clicked on one of the first few results, at least initially. If you didn’t find a site that met your expectations, you probably clicked the back button and scrolled down the page until you found what you were looking for.

If your site isn’t properly optimized, it’s safe to assume you’re only coming up on the first page for your branded search queries — although depending on the name of your business, that might not even be the case.

That means people who don’t know you exist but are looking for someone like you will never find you, and you’ll never even have a chance to tell them why you’re better than the competition.

That’s right: Without SEO, you’re giving leads away.

The good news is you’re making it really easy on your competitors who are doing SEO. Odds are, they are loving you for not putting up a fight.

So, who cares how search engines deliver results? You definitely should!

* How Many People Are Coming to Your Site
1. A website with Google Analytics installed. There's no excuse for not using Google Analytics. It's powerful, easy to use, and free, so why not? If you don't have the technical expertise to set up analytics tracking, get in touch with a web developer or digital marketer who can help you out.
 
2.Your Google Analytics log-in credentials. If you don't have your log-in information, and Google's recovery options can't help you, contact the person who installed your Analytics tracking code.
 
3. About a minute of free time.

* Domain Names & Hosting
A domain host is an internet service that manages your domain name, such as, example.com. Domain hosts use Domain Name System (DNS) records to connect your domain name with email, websites, and other web services. Popular domain hosts include GoDaddy, enom, DreamHost, and 1&1 IONOS, to name a few.

Purchasing a domain and website hosting together can save some money since many providers provide free domain registration to hosting customers. If users manage several websites, it can be a saving of hundreds of dollars per year if you bundle the two services together
