## CSS Introduction
*What is CSS !!*
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.
CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.
